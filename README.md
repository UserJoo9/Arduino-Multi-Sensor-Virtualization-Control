A robust system designed to bridge the gap between physical Arduino hardware and virtual data visualization. This project allows for the real-time monitoring, processing, and control of multiple sensor inputs through a centralized Python interface.

## ✨ Features
* **Multi-Sensor Support:** Simultaneously track data from various sensors (Temperature, Ultrasonic, LDR, etc.).
* **Virtualization Interface:** Real-time graphical representation of hardware data.
* **Serial Communication:** Optimized data streaming via Python's `pyserial` library.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Hardware:** Arduino (Uno/Mega/Nano)
* **Language:** C++ (Arduino Sketch) & Python (Control Interface)
* **Libraries:** PySerial, Matplotlib (for graphing), or Tkinter (for GUI).
